/*	isMagicWeapon // OPTIONAL //

	USE:	whether (true) or not (false) this weapon is a magical weapon
	This attribute only has an effect for attack calculations and magic item selection.
	Add this if you don't want class features and the like to add modifiers or write "Counts as magical" in the description of this attack.
	Also add this if you don't want this weapon to be an option for magical weapons to add their attributes to.
	Note that if you set the 'type' attribute to "Cantrip" or "Spell", it will already be treated as a magical attack.
	Weapons added by magic items using the 'weaponOptions' attribute will always have this attribute added and set to 'true'.
	Setting this to false is the same as not including this attribute.

	TYPE:	boolean
	USE:	whether (true) or not (false) the proficiency bonus should always be added for this weapon
	This attribute only has an effect if the character would otherwise not be proficient with this weapon.
	Add this for weapons where the normal way of determining proficiency would not produce the correct result.
	For example, if you set 'type' above to 'Cantrip', setting this to 'true' will have no effect.
	Another example, if you set 'type' above to 'Simple', setting this to 'true' will add proficiency
	even if the character is not proficient with simple weapons (or has the weapon listed in 'other weapon proficiencies').
	Setting this to false is the same as not including this attribute.
